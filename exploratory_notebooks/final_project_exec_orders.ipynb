Subject to Security Executive Agent authorizations consistent with section 3341(e)(5) of title 50, United States Code, the investigative agencies shall make reports, information, and other investigative material available, as necessary, to carry out the responsibilities set forth in this order, including but not limited to, authorized executive branch-sponsored research and initiatives for enterprise-wide continuous performance improvement of vetting policy and procedures, as permitted by law.”\\n(c) Section 1.2 of Executive Order 13467 is revised to read as follows:\\n\\n\\n“Sec. 1.2.
